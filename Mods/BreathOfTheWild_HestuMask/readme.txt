Some {limitations|decisions} due to the {weapons|armors} stats management in the inventory

NOTES:
- weapons bonuses documentation: https://github.com/m-byte918/BotW-Cheat-Codes/blob/master/All%20Versions/Equipped%20Gear%20Bonus%20Modifier%20%5BMegabyte918%5D
- bonuses updated when the inventory is closed
- only damage bonus for looted forest bows|weapons
- only shield guard Up bonus for looted forest shields
- a looted forest dweller's bow 5x15 becomes a forest dweller's bow 3x(25+bonus) (a forest dweller's bow 5x15 with an attack up bonus works in game but it is displayed as a bow 1x(15+bonus) in the inventory)
- drop a forest weapon then pick it back up with the Korok mask to apply the damage bonus
- use weapon mounts, bow mounts and shield mounts in the Link's house to save forest weapons for later use
- need 900 Korok seeds in the inventory for the max bonus --> If $MaxForestWeaponsBonus=50 in the rules.txt file, need 18 (900/50) Korok seeds in the inventory for one bonus {damage|shield guard Up} point

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Korok mask defense stat (1) not updated in the inventory (equipped armors total defense stat [with Korok mask defense bonus if necessary] is correct)
